Fun fact: Connect Four is also known as Captain's Mistress, Four Up, Plot Four, Find Four, Four in a Row, or Four in a Line.

      "Connect four of your checkers in a row while preventing your opponent from doing the same. But, look out-- your opponent can sneak up on you and win the game!"
            — Milton Bradley, Connect Four "Pretty Sneaky, Sis" television commercial, 1977

In this Connect Four, 2 Players alternate dropping one of their fish(tokens) into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended aquarium(grid). The fish swim straight down, occupying the next available space within the selected column. The first player to get four of their fish to form a school in a line, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins the game.
